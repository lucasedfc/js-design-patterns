## Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is useful when you want to maintain a list of dependents (observers) that are notified when a subject (observable) undergoes a change in state. It can also be used to decouple the subject from its observers, allowing for more flexibility and reusability in the code.

- If you have objects that need to be notified of changes in another object.
- If you want to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- If you want to decouple an object from its observers so that they can be added or removed dynamically.
