## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is useful when you have behaviors that will change in an object at runtime. It can be used to decouple the behavior from the object and make it more flexible and reusable in your code.

- If you need a single instance of a class throughout your program.
- If you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object.
- If you want to ensure thread safety when creating objects.
