## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is useful when you want to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and can be easily accessed throughout the application. It can also be used to control access to shared resources, such as a database connection, to prevent conflicts or data corruption.

- If you have behaviors that will change in an object at runtime.
- If you want to encapsulate specific algorithms or behaviors in their own classes.
- If you want to be able to switch between different algorithms or behaviors at runtime.
