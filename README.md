# Javacript Design Patterns

These are some of the design patterns used in javascript with a small demonstration, for more information on examples, advantages and implementation in other languages ​​you can see the documentation at [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)


## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is useful when you want to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and can be easily accessed throughout the application. It can also be used to control access to shared resources, such as a database connection, to prevent conflicts or data corruption.

For more information on the Singleton pattern, see the [Singleton Pattern README.md](./singleton/README.md) file.

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is useful when you have behaviors that will change in an object at runtime. It can be used to decouple the behavior from the object and make it more flexible and reusable in your code.

For more information on the Strategy pattern, see the [Strategy Pattern README.md](./strategy/README.md) file.

## Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is useful when you want to maintain a list of dependents (observers) that are notified when a subject (observable) undergoes a change in state. It can also be used to decouple the subject from its observers, allowing for more flexibility and reusability in the code.

For more information on the Observer pattern, see the [Observer Pattern README.md](./observer/README.md) file.

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern is useful when you want to add behavior to an object dynamically without changing its structure. It can be used to enhance the functionality of an object by wrapping it with one or more decorators that add new behaviors or modify existing ones.

For more information on the Decorator pattern, see the [Decorator Pattern README.md](./decorator/README.md) file.

## Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is useful when you want to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing you to create different representations of the same object. It can also be used to simplify object creation and avoid complex constructors.

For more information on the Builder pattern, see the [Builder Pattern README.md](./builder/README.md) file.

## State Pattern

The State pattern is useful when you want to allow an object to behave differently depending on its internal state. It can be used to simplify complex conditional statements and to improve the extensibility and maintainability of your code.

For more information on the State pattern, see the [State Pattern README.md](./state/README.md) file.

## Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern is useful when you want to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently. It can be used to decouple the interface from the implementation and to provide a more flexible and extensible design.

For more information on the Bridge pattern, see the [Bridge Pattern README.md](./bridge/README.md) file.
